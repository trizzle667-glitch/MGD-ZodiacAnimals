I went into this mod aiming to create enemy encounters that rival bosses in terms of complexity and quality, so a spent a fair amount of time thinking up mechanics that made the encounter and character interesting.

So behold the first encounter of the Zodiac mod, Vanesa, holder of the Bunny (Rabbit) Zodiac mark.
While I'm pretty exhausted from this start, If I continue this foray at a later date there are some design guidelines that I'll be trying to adhere to:
- Each character needs to represent one of the Zodiac marks in some way. This could be with physical characteristics, through their clothing, or through their personality.
- Each character has some main mechanic that is different than any other Zodiac.
- The mark they can apply to the player will interact with their main mechanic
- Marks apply some form of corruption on the player.
- They will get more moves if the player has the mark on them.
- There is some sort of outside-of-battle interaction with the player.
- Different Zodiacs will have different fetish focuses.

**Content Warnings**
This tag is here to warn you that some characters will be semi-furry ([furry chart](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/106/292/Furrychart.jpg)), but no higher. This is not much different than existing characters in MGD, but the warning is here on the off chance this turns someone off.

AI art was used. Like... all of the art was AI. Some of it better than others (Standing art was the worst imo) but I tried my best to keep the art consistent with the other art. Let me know how well it worked out.

AI was used for some portion of the writing. Some parts I let AI do its work from my initial framework of placeholder descriptions of what's happening, other times I had to yank the wheel away and do all of it myself. Most of the time it was somewhere between the two with me poking and prodding the AI to make changes to what I did or me making changes to what the AI did.

I'll make a mini-journal comment on how this whole AI process went for those who are interested ... when I have time.


**Installation**

Place the "Zodiacs" folder into the Mods folder of the game.
The layout should look like this in the end:
